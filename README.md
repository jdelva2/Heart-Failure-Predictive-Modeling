# [Heart Failure Predictive Modeling](https://jdelva2.github.io/Heart-Failure-Predictive-Modeling/)

## Purpose
The purpose of this project was to test multiple algorithms to create a predictive model that would best predict patient death during the follow up period after the patient was diagnosed.
Some of the algorithms include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier
- XGBoost Classifier
